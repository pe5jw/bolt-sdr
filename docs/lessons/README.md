# Lessons learned

Durable engineering notes for anyone working on Zeus. Unlike `docs/prd/` (product specs) and `docs/rca/` (per-incident post-mortems), this folder captures **load-bearing invariants** that aren't self-evident from the code — the kind of thing that would cost a future developer days if they tripped over it cold.

Add a lesson when:
- An RCA surfaced a gotcha that's specific to a library/API and could easily recur.
- A convention (color, port, protocol field, state flow) was chosen deliberately and deviating would break something.
- The rationale for a design choice lives in external reference code (Thetis) that a reader wouldn't know to look at.
